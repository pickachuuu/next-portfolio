            Developer with +{calculateDuration('2022-01-01', false)} years of JavaScript experience and a constant interest in learning new technologies. I have solid experience in Frontend development for web, mobile, and desktop applications, using technologies and frameworks like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Angular, Electron.js, and Ionic. Additionally, I have skills in Backend development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (NoSQL). I consistently follow best practices in prototyping, coding, clean architecture, SOLID principles, pixel-perfect design, GitFlow, and agile methodologies. I am currently exploring to be DevOps, by doing projects with tools and technologies such as (AWS, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform)

          A glimpse into the programming languages, libraries, and tools I've worked with. I began my programming journey around {calculateDuration('2022-01-01', false)} ago, and over the years, I've explored a variety of technologies across both backend and frontend development. I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science student, constantly learning and building.

            Event though the scope of web development is wide, I was very interested and focused on Frontend development.

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
