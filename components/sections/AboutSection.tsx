          Computer Science student at the University of San Carlos with hands-on experience in building modern web applications. 
          I specialize in frontend development using React, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and I have solid backend experience 
          with Express, Python, and SQL-based databases. I’m passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and continuously 
          improving through best practices such as clean architecture, modular design, and version control using Git. 
          I enjoy working on collaborative projects and exploring the full development lifecycle—from prototyping to deployment. 
          I’m currently deepening my skills in scalable system design and DevOps practices to become a more versatile developer.

          A glimpse into the programming languages, libraries, and tools I've worked with. I began my programming journey around {calculateDuration('2022-01-01', false)} ago, and over the years, I've explored a variety of technologies across both backend and frontend development. I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science student, constantly learning and building.

            Event though the scope of web development is wide, I was very interested and focused on Frontend development.

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am interested in learning Backend with other language like Java, Go or with Python. I also want to know how to make a video game with Unity or other and I am very interested in being a content creator whether programming or something else.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            For now I'm learning how to make applications with real time communication such as a chat using Socket.IO, I'm also starting to learn the way to be Devops using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS or others.
          </p>

          <p className='text-base text-gray-400'>
            I am also interested in learning other things besides programming such as 3D design with Blender and video editing with Davinci Resolve (these last two I would take as a hobby).
