        <TimelineEvent.Description>
          Frontend development and freelance website projects, including full-cycle delivery for a client using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. I applied best practices such as clean architecture, modular design, pixel-perfect implementation, and Git version control. The work was managed independently, following agile-inspired iterations and client feedback to ensure fast and flexible delivery.

        In addition to development, I also focused on SEO optimization and performance tuning. I utilized tools such as Google Search Console, Lighthouse, Vercel Analytics, and Bing Webmaster Tools to improve the site's search engine visibility and performance. This led to an enhanced online presence for the clientâ€™s business. I also handled ongoing site maintenance, ensuring the website stayed fast, accessible, and up to date.
